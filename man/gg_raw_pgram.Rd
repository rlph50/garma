\title{Display the raw periodogram for a time series, not on a log scale.
The standard "R" functions display periodograms on a log scale which can make it more difficult to locate high peaks in the spectrum at differning frequencies.
This routine will display the peaks on a raw scale.}
\usage{
gg_raw_pgram(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(num) This should be a numeric vector representing the process to estimate.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the raw periodogram
}
