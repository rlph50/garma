  Abstract                 = {Gaussian semiparametric or local Whittle estimation of the memory parameter in standard long memory processes was proposed by Robinson [18]. This technique shows several advantages over the popular log- periodogram regression introduced by Geweke and Porter–Hudak [7]. In particular under milder assumptions than those needed in the log periodogram regression it is asymptotically more efficient. We analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the Gaussian semiparametric estimate of the memory parameter in seasonal or cyclical long memory processes allowing for asymmetric spectral divergences or zeros. Consistency and asymptotic normality are obtained.},

When the filter is applied to white noise, a class of time series is generated with distinctive properties, particularly in the very low frequencies and provides potentially useful long‐memory forecasting properties. Such models are shown to possibly arise from aggregation of independent components. Generation and estimation of these models are considered and applications on generated and real data presented.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: Fractional differencing is a tool for modeling time series which have long term dependence; i.e., series in which the correlation between distant observations, though small, is not negligible. Fractionally differenced ARIMA models are formed by permitting the differencing parameter d in the familiar Box‐Jenkins ARIMA(p, d, q) models to take nonintegral values; they permit the simultaneous modeling of the long term and short‐term behavior of an observed time series. This paper discusses the usefulness of fractional differencing to time‐series modeling, with emphasis on hydrologic applications. A methodology for fitting fractionally differenced ARIMA models is described, and examples are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) can be interpreted as a filtering of a time series by a set of octave band filters such that the width of each band as a proportion of its center frequency is constant. A long-memory process having a power spectrum that plots as a straight line on log-frequency/log-power scales over many octaves of frequency is intrinsically related to such a structure. As an example of such processes, we focus on one class of discrete-time, stationary, long-memory processes, the fractionally differenced Gaussian white noise processes (fdGn). We show how the DWT breaks down a fdGn, and show the exact correlation structure of the resulting coefficients for different wavelets (Daubechies' minimum-phase and least-asymmetric and Haar). The DWT is an impressive "whitening filter." A discrete wavelet-based scheme for simulating fdGn's is discussed and is shown to be equivalent to a spectral decomposition of the covariance matrix of the process; however, it can be carried out using only information on the nature of the spectrum of the process--that is, time-domain information is not required. It produces results comparable with the exact Hosking method. We then show that, using wavelet methods, the spectral slope parameter d can be estimated as well, or better, than when using the best Fourier-based method known to us, namely regression on multitaper spectral ordinates. Since wavelet analysis and synthesis methods can be applied to a much wider variety of empirical or theoretical long-memory processes, wavelet methods could prove a valuable tool in the future in the analysis and synthesis of stochastic processes.},

  Abstract                 = {We use a series of monthly IBM product revenues to illustrate the usefulness of seasonal fractionally differenced ARMA models for business forecasting. By allowing two seasonal fractional differencing parameters in the model, one at lag three and the other at lag twelve, we obtain a stationary series without losing information about the process behavior through over-differencing. We apply modified identification and estimation techniques to the IBM revenue data and compare the resulting model with a specific non-fractional seasonal ARIMA model by looking at each model's forecasts. The fractionally differenced seasonal model gives more accurate next-quarter, next-half-year, next-year, and next-two- years forecasts than the non-fractional seasonal model based on criteria that are specifically constructed to reflect the accuracy of long-range periodic forecasts.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract. In recent work on time series analysis considerable interest has been focused on series having the property of long memory. Long memory is a characteristic of time series in which the dependence between distant observations is not negligible. The model that has been most frequently studied, which in some situations shows properties of long memory, is based on the autoregressive integrated moving‐average ARIMA(p, d, q) process. Hosking (Fractional differencing, Biometrika 68 (1) (1981), 165–76) generalized this model by permitting the degree of differencing d to take fractional values. He then demonstrated that for d in the range 0 < d < 0.5 the process is stationary and possesses the long memory property. Our study is based on the ARIMA(p, d, q) model when d takes any real non‐integer value in the interval (‐0.5, 0.5). The main aim of our study is to examine methods for estimating the parameters of this model. For estimating d we suggest an estimator based on the smoothed periodogram. Using an empirical approach we compare this estimator with other which are well known in the literature of long memory models, e.g. the raw periodogram regression method and the Hurst coefficient method.},

This extends the results in Jennrich (1969) and Wu (1981). (2) Under the same model, the jackknife estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the least‐squares estimator is shown to be consistent, which provides a theoretical justification of the empirical results in Duncan (1978) and the use of the jackknife method in large‐sample inferences.},

  Abstract                 = { We introduce the multiscale analysis of seasonal persistent processes, that is, time series models with a singularity in their spectral density function at one or more frequencies in [0,1/2]. The discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) and a nondecimated version of it known as the maximal overlap DWPT (MODWPT) are introduced as alternative methods to Fourier-based techniques for analyzing time series that exhibit seasonal long memory. The approximate log-linear relationship between the wavelet packet variance and frequency is used to produce a least squares estimator of the fractional difference parameter. Approximate maximum likelihood estimation is performed by replacing the variance/covariance matrix with a diagonalized matrix based on the DWPT. Simulations are performed to compare the wavelet-based techniques with the spectral estimate-based techniques for both least squares and maximum likelihood procedures. An application of this methodology to atmospheric and economic time series is used for demonstration purposes. },

  Abstract                 = {This article proposes a new method for simulating a Gaussian process, whose spectrum diverges at one or multiple frequencies in [0, 1/2] (not necessarily at zero). The method uses a generalization of the discrete wavelet transform, the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT), and requires only explicit knowledge of the spectral density function of the process - not its autocovariance sequence. An orthonormal basis is selected such that the spectrum of the wavelet coefficients is as at as possible across specific frequency intervals, thus producing approximately uncorrelated wavelet coefficients. This method is compared to a popular time-domain technique based on the Levinson-Durbin recursions. Simulations show that the DWPT-based method performs comparably to the time-domain technique for a variety of sample sizes and processes - at significantly reduced computational time. The degree of approximation and reduction in computer time may be adjusted through selection of the orthonormal basis and wavelet filter.},

  Abstract                 = {Long‐memory models have been used by several authors to model data with persistent autocorrelations. The fractional and fractional autoregressive moving‐average (FARMA) models describe long‐memory behavior associated with an infinite peak in the spectrum at f = 0. The Gegenbauer and Gegenbauer ARMA (GARMA) processes of Gray, Zhang and Woodward (On generalized fractional processes. J. Time Ser. Anal. 10 (1989), 233–57) can model long‐term periodic behavior for any frequency 0 ≤f≤ 0.5. In this paper we introduce a k‐factor extension of the Gegenbauer and GARMA models that allows for long‐memory behavior to be associated with each of k frequencies in [0, 0.5]. We prove stationarity conditions for the k‐factor model and discuss issues such as parameter estimation, model iden‐ tification, realization generation and forecasting. A two factor GARMA model is then applied to the Mauna Loa atmospheric CO2 data. It is shown that this model provides a reasonable fit to the CO2 data and produces excellent forecasts.},
