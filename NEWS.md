# garma 0.9.7

Version 0.9.7 adds the "tsdiag" function for garma models - this is essentially a copy of the base stats 'tsdiag'
but the fitdf for the Ljung-Box test is set to p+q+k*2.

There was a bug with the standard errors which resulted in Nan being returned for some parameters. This has been fixed.

The override of the ggplot function for garma models has been removed as this was not standard - the correct way to do this
is 'autoplot' so now the autoplot function has the ability to generate forecasts and plot them.

A new optimisation method has been added for the "garma" function - this is a genetic algorithm from package GA.
It can be used by specifying opt_method='ga'. For now please treat this as experimental - it has given some interesting
results on some standard problems and these probably need to be checked further before more general use.

Otherwise some redundant code has been removed, and also the restriction that integer differencing be restricted to 1 only.

# garma 0.9.6

Version 0.9.6 implements new functions to more accurately reflect residuals, fitted values and predictions. 
Some changes have been made to the plotting routines to provide default titles and captions etc. 
Further some functions like AIC(), logLik(), vcov(), and coef() have been implemented, to provide 
greater similarity with the standard 'arima' functionality.

Finally given the trouble with forecasting with integer differencing > 1, there is a new restriction in the code to restrict
the integer differencing to be either 0 or 1. This does not affect the fractional differencing component of the models. 
If the problems with forecasting higher integer differencing can be resolved, this restriction will be lifted in the future.

In particular please note that the 'predict'/'forecast' function(s) now use the algorithm of (2009) Godet, F
"Linear prediction of long-range dependent time series", ESAIM: PS 13 115-134. DOI: 10.1051/ps:2008015.

**WARNING**: forecasts generated by this version will be different from previous versions.
